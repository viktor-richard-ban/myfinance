# About the project
This project has been created to showcase my current knowledge and it constitutes my portfolio. This native iOS application has been built in MVVM+C architecture and enhanced with reactive elements by RxSwift. UI elements have been built with UIKit.
In the future, I would like to add some components built in SwiftUI, like widgets, but currently, it is out of scope.
